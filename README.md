- biogeography part is found under the ID: __PRJNA524532__
- development pasrt is found under the ID: __PRJNA606063__

The data folder contains all necessary input files for reproducing the code. 
The analysis is split into different parts depending on the questions and some are dependent. To fully reproduce the code one should run first the 16S_US_analysis.R script followed by 16S_COL_analysis.R, 16S_COL2_analysis.R and finally ITS_analysis.R.
