## Data
The 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon data from the biogeography study (2017) are available on NCBI under the BioProject PRJNA524532. The 16D rRNA amplicon data from the development study (2018) is available on NCBI under BioProject PRJNA606063. The data from Columbian studies for our meta-analysis were obtained using NCBI BioProjects PRJEB26084 and PRJEB19467.

## Abstract
The full potential of managing microbial communities to support plant health is yet-unrealized, in part because it remains difficult to ascertain which members are most important for the plant. However, microbes that consistently associate with a plant species across varied field conditions and over plant development likely engage with the host or host environment. Here, we applied abundance-occupancy concepts from macroecology to quantify the core membership of bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Our study investigated the microbiome membership that persisted over multiple dimensions important for plant agriculture, including major U.S. growing regions (Michigan, Nebraska, Colorado, and Washington), plant development, annual plantings, and divergent genotypes, and also included re-analysis of public data from plants grown in Colombia. We found 48 core bacterial taxa that were consistently detected in all samples, inclusive of all datasets and dimensions. This suggests reliable enrichment of these taxa to the plant environment and time-independence of their association with the plant. More generally, this work provides a robust approach for systematically identifying persistent microbiome memberships in other hosts or systems.
